# Spotify App
A tkinter app that uses the Spotify Web API to search for artists.
Can save selected artists in a csv as well as generate a bokeh plot to compare album release histories.

# Features to add:
- Option to remove/clear artists from list of artists to compare
- Option to save bokeh graphs as different files (rather than overwriting the same file)
- Implementing bokeh app to allow for active interaction
- Spotify - Artist Releases (b).ipynb: adding spotify's sound analysis metrics to each album tooltip (loudness, danceability, etc.)
